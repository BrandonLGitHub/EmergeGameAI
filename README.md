# Sandy AI
Sandy AI is a program that facilitates a solo variation of the 
board game Emerge, a game created by Adam DeYoung and published by Padasaurus Games. 

The program will make decisions based off its current status in the game and complete 
the necessary steps to play, like rolling dice and spending them, with minimal player input

This project has no affiliation with the creators of Emerge and is intended 
for entertainment purposes.
